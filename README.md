# Advanced-MPI-2D-Decomposition

A simple Jacobi iteration can be used to approximate the solution to a linear system of equations. In this project, the iteration is used to solve the Laplace equation in two dimensions with finite differences. The numerical computation can be showed with the sudo code below.
